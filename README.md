# DLH Team 169 SANSFormers

This repository is the official implementation of [SANSformers: Self-Supervised Forecasting in ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS with Attention-Free Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13672). 


## Requirements and Setup

- You need to have access to the MIMC-IV v1.0 dataset
- Download the ZIP file and mount it to the Jupyter Notebook file attached.
- Clone this repository and make sure all the files in here are downloaded, mount them onto the drive.




## Results

These two models achieves the following performance:

| Model name         | loss  | bin_loss | auc_bin
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |-----|
| Additive Sansformer   |     66%        |      66%      | 66%
| Axial Sansformer  |     66%       |      66%      |66%

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
